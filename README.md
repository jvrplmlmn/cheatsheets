cheatsheets
===========

This is a collection of stuff that I've using and currently use on a daily basis.

The purpouse of this repo is to serve as online documentation to check stuff on-the-go.

This toolbox includes:

- Sysadmin: Linux, Solaris, HP-UX
- Scripts & one-liners: shellscript, python & perl
- Data processing: awk, sed
- Middleware: Weblogic
- Databases: Oracle

Feel free to drop me a message (or a pull-request) if you catch some error!

Soon I'll add some new stuff:
- Ruby, RoR
- DevOps: Chef, Puppet
